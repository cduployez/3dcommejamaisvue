/*
The goal of this exercise is to create a table using an array. This could be used for your scoreboard project.
The array is composed by:
    1- The time
    2- The action that is concerned
    3- The concerned team (if both are concerned, you have to set null)
    4- The comment

The table will look like this:

|| Team 1 | Chrono | Team 2 ||
------------------------------
| com 1   | time   |         |
|         | time   | com 2   |
....


Do it in 2 times:
    1- Without jQuery
    2- With jQuery
